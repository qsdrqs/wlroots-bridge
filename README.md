# wlroots-bridge

First-party wlroots-Wayland bridge for Claude Desktop's Computer Use on Linux. A
single pure-Rust, statically-linked binary that replaces the shell-out chain
(`ydotool` for input, `grim` for screenshots, `hyprctl` / `swaymsg`+`jq` /
`niri msg` for window enumeration) on **wlroots-based Wayland sessions**
(Sway, Hyprland, Niri). It is a sibling of
[`x11-bridge`](https://github.com/patrickjaja/x11-bridge) (X11 / XWayland) and
[`kwin-portal-bridge`](https://github.com/patrickjaja/kwin-portal-bridge)
(KDE/Wayland) and speaks the **same kebab-case one-shot CLI + JSON contract**,
so the Claude Desktop JS executor (`js/cu_linux_executor.js` in
`claude-desktop-bin`) treats them interchangeably and picks a backend per
session without changing how it parses output.

**Status: experimental, v0.1.** All subcommands are implemented: output
enumeration (`wl_output` + `xdg-output`), `wlr-screencopy` capture (JPEG),
virtual-pointer / virtual-keyboard input synthesis, and foreign-toplevel window
queries + activation. Unit tests cover the pure logic (key-spec parsing, XKB
keymap generation, pixel decoding, JSON shapes); the live protocol paths are
exercised by a headless-sway smoke test in CI. Wiring the resolver into
`claude-desktop-bin`'s `js/cu_linux_executor.js` is a separate workstream.

## Sibling bridges

Four sibling projects cover the Linux session types with one shared JSON
contract:

| Bridge | Covers | Input / capture mechanism |
|---|---|---|
| `x11-bridge` | X11 and XWayland fallback | XTEST input + `GetImage` capture (stateless, one-shot) |
| `kwin-portal-bridge` | KDE Plasma / Wayland | RemoteDesktop + ScreenCast portal, PipeWire (long-lived session) |
| **`wlroots-bridge`** | **Sway / Hyprland / Niri (wlroots-Wayland)** | **virtual-pointer / virtual-keyboard + wlr-screencopy (stateless, one-shot)** |
| `gnome-portal-bridge` *(in development)* | GNOME / Wayland | portal + PipeWire |

## Requirements

The compositor must advertise the wlroots protocol extensions this bridge binds:

- `zwlr_virtual_pointer_manager_v1` (pointer input)
- `zwp_virtual_keyboard_manager_v1` (keyboard input)
- `zwlr_screencopy_manager_v1` (screenshots)
- `zwlr_foreign_toplevel_management_unstable_v1` (window list + activate),
  with `ext_foreign_toplevel_list_v1` as a list-only fallback for compositors
  that advertise only the ext protocol
- `zxdg_output_manager_v1` (logical output geometry)

Sway, Hyprland, and **Niri all advertise the wlr protocols above** (including
the wlr foreign-toplevel manager with `activate` - verified against niri's
source), so window activation works on all three. Niri additionally gates these
as privileged protocols, disabled only for sandboxed / security-context clients.
Run `wlroots-bridge doctor` to see what the running compositor advertises (see
[CLI overview](#cli-overview)).

## Portability (static musl, incl. NixOS)

`wlroots-bridge` is **pure Rust with zero C dependencies** - it uses
`wayland-client`'s `client_rust` backend (no `libwayland`), generates its XKB
keymap text itself (no `libxkbcommon`), and uses the `image` crate for JPEG. It
builds as a **fully static musl binary** linked with `rust-lld`, so there is no
external cross-linker and no runtime library dependency at all. The same binary
runs on Arch, Ubuntu, Debian, Fedora, RHEL, and **NixOS** without patching an
interpreter or shipping shared libraries.

## Build

```sh
# Native release build:
cargo build --release

# Fully-static musl builds (recommended - no C linking anywhere):
rustup target add x86_64-unknown-linux-musl
cargo build --release --target x86_64-unknown-linux-musl

rustup target add aarch64-unknown-linux-musl
cargo build --release --target aarch64-unknown-linux-musl
```

`.cargo/config.toml` sets `rust-lld` + `+crt-static` for both musl targets, so
those commands work with just the toolchain installed - no `musl-gcc`, no
`gcc-aarch64-linux-gnu`.

### Reproducible local pipeline build

`scripts/pipeline-build-local.sh` builds **both** musl targets in a single
Docker run (mirroring CI) and drops the binaries in `./dist/`:

```sh
./scripts/pipeline-build-local.sh
# dist/wlroots-bridge          (x86_64, statically linked)
# dist/wlroots-bridge-aarch64  (aarch64, statically linked)
```

### Local end-to-end test (headless sway)

`scripts/test-headless-sway.sh` starts a throwaway headless sway compositor on a
private `WAYLAND_DISPLAY` and runs the full subcommand sequence against it
(doctor / screens / screenshot / zoom / input / held-button pair). This is the
only way to exercise the live protocol paths without a real Wayland session
(useful on an X11 host). Requires `sway`:

```sh
cargo build --release
scripts/test-headless-sway.sh
```

## CLI overview

One-shot subcommands. Each prints a single JSON object/array on stdout; on
failure it prints a message to stderr and exits 1 (clap parse errors exit 2).

| Subcommand | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `doctor` | Wayland env + which globals the compositor advertises |
| `screens` | Enumerate outputs (wl_output + xdg-output) |
| `windows` | Enumerate windows (foreign-toplevel) |
| `screenshot [--display N]` | Capture a full monitor |
| `zoom --display N --x --y --w --h` | Capture a region within a monitor |
| `pointer-move` / `-click` / `-scroll` / `-drag` | Pointer actions (virtual pointer) |
| `left-mouse-down` / `left-mouse-up` | Press/release-and-hold the left button |
| `key-sequence --keys <spec>` | Send a key combo, e.g. `ctrl+shift+tab` |
| `type --text <t>` | Type text as key events |
| `hold-key --key <k>... --duration-ms N` | Hold keys for a fixed duration |
| `frontmost-app` | Report the activated app |
| `app-under-point --x --y` | Unsupported on Wayland (returns null) |
| `cursor-position` | Unsupported on Wayland (exits 1) |
| `activate-window --window <id>` | Raise + focus a window (wlr foreign-toplevel; works on Sway/Hyprland/Niri) |
| `session-start` / `session-end` | No-ops (report `{"ok":true}`) |

```sh
wlroots-bridge doctor
wlroots-bridge screens
wlroots-bridge screenshot --display eDP-1
wlroots-bridge zoom --display eDP-1 --x 100 --y 100 --w 400 --h 300
wlroots-bridge pointer-click --x 640 --y 480 --button left --count 2
wlroots-bridge key-sequence --keys 'ctrl+shift+tab' --repeat 1
wlroots-bridge type --text 'hello' --delay-ms 12
```

Keyboard input uses physical US keycodes when all requested symbols have
supported positions. This supports applications that consume or forward physical
keycodes instead of interpreting the uploaded XKB mapping; QEMU GTK is a verified
example. Text interpreted by the receiving system requires a matching US keyboard
layout. Other symbol sets, including mixed ASCII/Unicode requests, use dynamic
XKB mappings for text clients; this does not provide arbitrary Unicode input to
applications that forward physical keycodes.

See [DESIGN.md](DESIGN.md) for the full subcommand -> JSON output contract, the
key-spec grammar, the coordinate system, the held-button mechanism, the keymap
generation approach, and the wlroots-specific contract deviations.

## Bundling into claude-desktop-bin

`wlroots-bridge` is intended to be consumed by
[`claude-desktop-bin`](https://github.com/patrickjaja/claude-desktop-bin) the
same way the other bridges are: the pre-built static binary is shipped inside the
package and the JS executor resolves it at runtime, in order:

1. the `WLROOTS_BRIDGE_BIN` environment variable (explicit override),
2. `process.resourcesPath` (the bundled copy inside the packaged app),
3. `wlroots-bridge` on `$PATH` (a system install).

Because the binary is fully static, the bundled copy runs on every supported
distro without extra runtime dependencies. Wiring the resolver into
`js/cu_linux_executor.js` is a follow-up on the `claude-desktop-bin` side and is
out of scope for this repo.
