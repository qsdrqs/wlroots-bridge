# wlroots-bridge - design & contract (v0.1, experimental)

First-party wlroots-Wayland bridge for Claude Desktop's Computer Use on Linux.
It replaces the shell-out chain (`ydotool` for input, `grim` for screenshots,
`hyprctl` / `swaymsg`+`jq` / `niri msg` for window enumeration) on
**wlroots-based Wayland sessions** (Sway, Hyprland, Niri) with a single
pure-Rust, statically-linkable binary. It is the direct sibling of `x11-bridge`
(X11 / XWayland) and `kwin-portal-bridge` (KDE/Wayland) and speaks the **same
JSON contract**, so the JS executor treats them interchangeably.

- **Invoked by:** `js/cu_linux_executor.js` in `claude-desktop-bin`, via
  `execFileSync(bin, [subcommand, ...args])`, reading `JSON.parse(stdout.trim())`.
  The binary resolves from `$WLROOTS_BRIDGE_BIN` / `resourcesPath` / `$PATH`
  (wiring the resolver into the JS side is a separate workstream).
- **One-shot:** every subcommand is a short-lived process. No daemon, no
  persistent portal session (see [No-daemon rationale](#no-daemon-rationale)).
  The **one** exception is the `left-mouse-down` holder process (see
  [Held-button mechanism](#held-button-mechanism)).
- **Output:** exactly one JSON object/array on stdout. Errors: a human message
  on stderr and **exit code 1**. clap parse errors exit 2.

## Technology (pure Rust, Smithay ecosystem)

`wayland-client` (its `client_rust` backend - **no libwayland**),
`wayland-protocols` (`xdg_output`, `ext_foreign_toplevel_list`),
`wayland-protocols-wlr` (`virtual_pointer`, `screencopy`, `foreign_toplevel`),
`wayland-protocols-misc` (`virtual_keyboard`). Plus `image` (JPEG), `xkeysym`,
`clap`, `serde`/`serde_json`, `base64`, `anyhow`. **No libxkbcommon** - the XKB
keymap the virtual keyboard needs is generated as text and compiled by the
compositor (see [Keymap generation](#keymap-generation)). The result is a fully
static musl binary that runs on every distro without runtime dependencies.

## Coordinate system

All coordinates are **Wayland global logical pixels** - the same space the JS
sends (`Math.round(x)`, `Math.round(y)`). A multi-monitor layout is one logical
plane; a monitor's `geometry.x/y` is its offset within it (from `xdg-output`
`logical_position`). Absolute pointer motion maps a global logical coordinate
into the union of all outputs' logical extents (see
[Pointer input](#pointer-input)). The `screencopy` buffer is in an output's
**physical** pixels; `zoom` scales the requested logical region by the
buffer/logical ratio before cropping, so fractional-scaled outputs crop
correctly.

Wayland has **no "primary" output**. We designate the output at logical `(0,0)`
as primary/active; if none sits there, the first enumerated output. Both flags
(`is_primary` / `is_active`) are set on that one output so the JS `isPrimary`
display picker resolves unambiguously.

## Subcommand -> JSON output contract

Shapes mirror `x11-bridge` (`src/output.rs`) 1:1 and are verified against the JS
reader in `cu_linux_executor.js`. Field-name casing is **not uniform** and must
be preserved: screenshots/app-refs are camelCase; screens/windows are
snake_case.

| Subcommand | Output shape | JS reader (evidence) |
|---|---|---|
| `doctor` | `{wayland_display, compositor, globals:{virtual_pointer, virtual_keyboard, screencopy, foreign_toplevel_wlr, foreign_toplevel_ext, xdg_output, wl_output_count, wl_seat, wl_shm}}` | human-facing only; not parsed by JS |
| `screens` | `[{id, name, geometry:{x,y,width,height}, scale, refresh_millihz, is_active, is_primary}]` | `mapRustScreenToDisplay` reads `geometry.*`, `scale`, `is_primary`, `name`, `id` (-> `_bridgeId`) |
| `screenshot [--display N]` | `{base64, width, height, displayWidth, displayHeight, displayId, originX, originY}` (camelCase) | `screenshotResultFromRust` reads `result.displayWidth`/`displayHeight`/`originX`/`originY` |
| `zoom --x --y --w --h [--display N]` | `{base64, width, height}` | `zoom` reads `result.base64`/`width`/`height` |
| `windows` | `[{id, title, geometry, pid, desktop_file_name, resource_class, resource_name, window_role, window_type, is_dock, is_desktop, is_visible, is_minimized, is_normal_window, is_dialog, transient, transient_for, output, stacking_order, is_active, exclude_from_capture, keep_above}]` (snake_case) | `_appRefFromWindow` / `openApp` read `desktop_file_name`, `resource_class`, `is_minimized`, `is_visible`, `is_active`, `is_dock`, `is_desktop`, `title`, `id` |
| `cursor-position` | **error, exit 1** (unqueryable) | `getCursorPosition` uses Electron `getCursorScreenPoint()` instead |
| `frontmost-app` | `{bundleId, displayName}` (camelCase) | `_appRefFromCommand` reads `result.bundleId`/`displayName` |
| `app-under-point --x --y` | `null` (best-effort unsupported) | `_appRefFromCommand` tolerates null |
| `activate-window --window <id>` | `{activated: <id>}` | `activateWindow` ignores the body |
| `pointer-move --x --y` | `{action, x, y}` (camelCase) | body ignored |
| `pointer-click --x --y [--button] [--count] [--modifier ...]` | `{action, x, y}` | body ignored |
| `pointer-scroll --x --y [--dx] [--dy]` | `{action, x, y}` | body ignored |
| `pointer-drag --from-x --from-y --to-x --to-y` | `{action, fromX, fromY, toX, toY}` | body ignored |
| `left-mouse-down` / `left-mouse-up` | `{action, button, isHeld}` | body ignored |
| `key-sequence --keys <spec> [--repeat N]` | `{action, keys, repeat?}` | body ignored |
| `type --text <t> [--delay-ms N]` | `{action, text, charCount}` | body ignored |
| `hold-key --key <k>... --duration-ms N` | `{action, keys, durationMs}` | body ignored |
| `session-start [--foreground]` | `{ok:true, session:"noop"}` | `execBridge` tolerates any/empty output |
| `session-end` | `{ok:true, ended:true}` | same |

## `--display` selection

`--display <name>` matches an output's `name` (the `wl_output` connector name,
e.g. `eDP-1`, `DP-2`, or the `xdg-output` name as a fallback). The JS passes
`display._bridgeId`, which is the `id` field from `screens` (= the output name).
Default (no flag): the output at logical `(0,0)`, else the first.

## Key-spec grammar

Accepted by `key-sequence` (and each `--key` of `hold-key`). **Identical to
x11-bridge** (the parser + `CU_KEY_NAMES` / `MODIFIER_TOKENS` tables are ported
verbatim from `x11-bridge/src/input/keymap.rs`, which extracted them from
`_mapKey` in `cu_linux_executor.js`):

```
spec     := token ("+" token)*
token    := modifier | keyname
modifier := ctrl | control | alt | shift | super | meta | cmd | command
keyname  := <CU key-name from table> | <single literal char>
```

- Case-insensitive. The base key is the last non-modifier token.
- **Modifier aliases:** `cmd`, `command`, `meta` normalize to **`super`**;
  `control` -> `ctrl`.
- CU key-name table (CU token -> X11 keysym name): `enter`/`return`->`Return`,
  `backspace`->`BackSpace`, `delete`->`Delete`, `escape`/`esc`->`Escape`,
  `tab`->`Tab`, `space`/` `->`space`, arrows, `home`/`end`,
  `pageup`/`page_up`->`Prior`, `pagedown`/`page_down`->`Next`,
  `capslock`->`Caps_Lock`. Anything else passes through as a keysym by char/name.

## Keymap generation

The `zwp_virtual_keyboard_v1` protocol requires uploading an XKB keymap fd
before sending keycodes; the compositor compiles it. To avoid linking
libxkbcommon (which would break the pure-Rust static build), we **generate the
XKB keymap text ourselves** (the wtype technique, hand-rolled in
`src/input/keymap.rs::generate_keymap`):

- When all requested symbols have physical US keyboard positions, we upload
  the standard `evdev+aliases(qwerty)` / `pc+us+inet(evdev)` keymap and send those
  physical evdev codes, including real modifier positions. Uppercase letters
  and shifted punctuation press Shift. This supports applications that consume
  or forward hardware keycodes rather than translated symbols. QEMU GTK is a
  verified example. The receiving system must use a matching US layout for
  text to match.
- Other symbol sets use sequential XKB keycodes: four fixed modifier keys (Control, Shift,
  Alt, Super with proper `modifier_map` entries), then one keycode per requested
  keysym.
- In the dynamic keymap, each requested keysym is bound at **both** shift levels
  of its keycode to the exact glyph. This retains Unicode input for text
  clients; dynamic keymaps do not provide Unicode input to VM viewers that
  forward physical keycodes. A mixed ASCII/Unicode request uses this dynamic
  path for the entire symbol set.
- Modifiers are driven with both key events and explicit `modifiers()` state
  updates, including Shift during typing, as required by niri/Smithay.
- Named keys use their X keysym name (`Return`, `space`, `F5`); Latin-1 glyphs
  their name (`eacute`) or `U00E9`; CJK/emoji the Unicode symbol name
  (`U597D`, `U1F600`) via the keysym encoding `0x01000000 | codepoint`.
- The `key` request carries the **Linux evdev code** = XKB keycode - 8.
- `type` builds one keymap holding every *distinct* char in the text (repeated
  chars reuse a keycode), so a whole string needs a single upload. Texts with
  more than 200 distinct glyphs page to a per-char keymap (correct, slower).

The keymap text is written to a `memfd` (falling back to an unlinked
`$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR` file) and uploaded with a NUL terminator, as xkbcommon
expects.

## Pointer input

`zwlr_virtual_pointer_manager_v1.create_virtual_pointer` (no seat hint - the
compositor assigns the default seat). Absolute motion uses
`motion_absolute(time, x, y, x_extent, y_extent)` where the extents are the
**union of all outputs' logical space** (right/bottom edge of the bounding box).
Mapping a global logical coordinate into that full extent is what makes a single
coordinate land correctly across a multi-monitor layout; creating the pointer
per-output would restrict motion to one monitor. Every event group is closed
with `frame()`.

- **Buttons:** evdev codes `BTN_LEFT=0x110`, `BTN_MIDDLE=0x112`,
  `BTN_RIGHT=0x111`; press+frame, release+frame.
- **Scroll:** `axis` with ~15.0 units per notch. Positive `dy` = down, positive
  `dx` = right (matching the KDE / x11-bridge convention).
- **Drag:** press, ~20 interpolated `motion_absolute` steps ~8 ms apart,
  release (mirrors x11-bridge).
- **Click modifiers** (`--modifier ctrl`): held on a virtual keyboard for the
  duration of the click burst, released after.

### Held-button mechanism

`left-mouse-down` / `left-mouse-up` are the only stateful pair. A virtual
pointer's held buttons are **released the instant the client disconnects**, so a
one-shot process cannot leave a button held. We therefore implement
`left-mouse-down` by **daemonizing a holder process**:

1. The command forks; the child `setsid()`s to detach.
2. The child opens its **own fresh Wayland connection** (proxies are not
   fork-safe), presses `BTN_LEFT` + frame, and writes its PID to a pidfile in
   `$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR` (`wlroots-bridge-lmb[-<profile>].pid`, profile-suffixed so
   multi-profile Desktop instances don't collide).
3. It then blocks on a `SIGTERM`-driven loop, servicing the connection so the
   held button stays alive.
4. The parent returns immediately with `{isHeld:true}`.

`left-mouse-up` reads the pidfile and sends `SIGTERM`; the holder releases the
button (its own disconnect also releases it as a backstop), removes the pidfile,
and exits. Both commands are idempotent: a stale/dead pidfile is ignored, and
releasing when nothing is held is not an error.

## Windows

`zwlr_foreign_toplevel_management_unstable_v1` lists toplevels with `app_id` /
`title` / `state` and supports `activate`; `activate-window` uses its `activate`
request with a `wl_seat`. **All three target compositors advertise it** - Sway,
Hyprland, and Niri (verified against niri's source: `src/protocols/foreign_toplevel.rs`
implements the `zwlr_foreign_toplevel_manager_v1` global with an `activate`
handler, in addition to `ext_foreign_toplevel_list_v1`). So on Sway/Hyprland/Niri
this bridge takes the wlr path and `activate-window` works everywhere.

The `ext_foreign_toplevel_list_v1` (staging) path is kept as a **fallback for
list-only compositors** that advertise the ext protocol but not the wlr manager.
That protocol has no `activate` (so `activate-window` errors on such a
compositor) and no state (windows report neutral state). It is not the path any
of the three primary compositors actually take, but it broadens coverage.

**Contract deviations (wlroots-specific):**

- Neither protocol exposes **geometry**, so every `WindowInfo.geometry` is
  `{0,0,0,0}`. Documented; the JS window helpers that matter
  (`_appRefFromWindow`, `openApp` matching) key off `app_id`/`title`/state, not
  geometry.
- `app-under-point` therefore returns **null** (best-effort unsupported) - there
  is no geometry to hit-test.
- `resource_class` and `desktop_file_name` are both set to the `app_id`;
  `resource_name` is null. `bundle_id` derivation strips a trailing `.desktop`.
- `exclude_from_capture` is always `false` (no wlroots equivalent).
- `id` is the foreign-toplevel handle's protocol object id as a decimal string
  (or, for the ext protocol, its stable `identifier` when provided).
- `frontmost-app` picks the `activated` toplevel, else the first.

**Niri note:** niri gates `wlr-screencopy`, `virtual-pointer`, `virtual-keyboard`,
and the foreign-toplevel protocols as **privileged** - it disables them for
clients that connect through a Wayland security-context (sandboxed clients). The
bridge runs as an ordinary client (launched by Claude Desktop, not inside a
sandbox), so it gets full access; a future sandboxed deployment would see these
globals disappear from the registry, which `doctor` would surface.

## cursor-position

**Not queryable on Wayland**: no protocol exposes the global pointer position
without input focus. The command exits 1 with a clean error. The JS executor
uses Electron's `getCursorScreenPoint()` on this path anyway, so this is never a
functional gap.

## Error contract

- Success: one JSON value on stdout, exit 0.
- Failure: `anyhow` error chain printed to stderr (`{error:#}`), exit 1.
- Unknown/invalid CLI: clap message on stderr, exit 2.

## No-daemon rationale

Unlike `kwin-portal-bridge` (which runs a long-lived `session-start` daemon to
keep a RemoteDesktop/ScreenCast portal grant + PipeWire stream alive), the
wlroots virtual-input and screencopy protocols are **stateless per request** and
need no prior grant. Every subcommand opens a fresh connection, does its work,
and exits. `session-start`/`session-end` are no-ops that report `{ok:true}` to
satisfy the JS session bookkeeping. The single stateful exception is the
`left-mouse-down` holder process described above.

## Explicitly out of scope for v0.1 (matches x11-bridge)

- **`open-app` / `list-installed-apps` / `get-app-icon`** - the JS executor
  resolves and launches `.desktop` entries portably in-process.
- **`read-clipboard` / `write-clipboard`** - the Electron `clipboard` API is
  used directly by the JS in non-Cowork mode; a `wlr-data-control` path is
  deferred.
- **Teach overlays**, **capture-exclusion / set-window-geometry / keep-above** -
  compositor-specific niceties with no portable wlroots path in v0.1.

## Future work

- **`ext_image_copy_capture`**: some compositors advertise it alongside (or
  instead of) `wlr-screencopy`. v0.1 only implements `wlr-screencopy` (Sway,
  Hyprland, and Niri all ship it). Adding the ext protocol would broaden
  compositor coverage.
- **GNOME-Wayland** is covered by a separate `gnome-portal-bridge` (in
  development), not this binary.
